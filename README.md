# Catechesis for Preschoolers

This folder is for a variety of materials related to helping Kiran (and potentially other preschoolers) to grow up into Christ-centered kids. In general, the plan for catechesis centers on a couple different things:

The Lutheran, Catholic, and Greek Orthodox catechisms agree on a key catechetical organization:
1. The Dogmatical (focused on the Creed)
2. The Ethical (focused on the Commandments and Sermon on the Mount)
3. The Ceremonial (focused on the Lord's Prayer, Sacraments, and Liturgy)

In this spirit, then, the contents of this curriculum are as follows:
Credo:



1. The Lord's Prayer
1. The Great Narrative
1. The Commandments
1. The Gospels
1. The Creed
1. Christian Virtues
1. The Sacraments


Some of the key things I'd like to see included in every lesson:
1. Scripture Memorization
2. Arts/Crafts
3. Music/Singing
