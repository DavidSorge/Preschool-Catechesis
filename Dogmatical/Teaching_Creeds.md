# Teaching Creeds

Basic dogmatical teaching in the main branches of the church (that I am familiar with) revolves first and foremost around the Apostle's Creed. However, I am sensitive to N.T. Wright's critique that the apostle's creed, while a good confessional tool, was not designed as a pedagogical one, and doesn't cover the pedagogical bases you really want to cover. The point being that there is a lot more to the narrative both before the point at which the narrative mode of the creed kicks in (the nativity), and between Christ's nativity, passion, and resurrection.

So, to address the first gap, one potentially useful tool is the first part of the Creed of Aphrahat (Aphraates) the Syrian:

> Now this is faith,
>
> When a man shall believe in God, the Lord of all,
> Who made the heavens and the earth and the seas and all that is in them,
> Who made Adam in His image,
> Who gave the Law to Moses,
> Who sent His Spirit in the Prophets,
> Who sent the Messiah into the world,
>
> And that a man should believe in the bringing to life of the dead
> and believe also in the mystery of Baptism:
>
> This is the Faith of the Church of God.

This begins to deal with the front part of the story, contextualizing the Messiah in terms of Adam, Moses, and the Prophets (though interestingly not Abraham or David, who would seem to be notable points in the story.)

Another approach would be to describe a sequence of covenants:
1. The Edenic Covenant (Genesis 1:28-30)
2. The Noahide Covenant (Genesis 9:1-17)
3. The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:2-3, 7, 13:14-17, 15:1, 4, 18-21, 17:3-14)
4. The Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19-24)
5. The Aaronic Covenant (Numbers 25:12-13, Nehemiah 13:29, Malachi 2:8, Jeremiah 33:20-21)
6. The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7)
7. The Exile and the apparent breaking of the Davidic and Aaronic Covenants
8. The New/Renewed Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31, 1 Cor 11:23-26, Luke 22, Hebrews 8-10)
